# CarRentalSystemJava
This Java program implements a car rental system, allowing users to rent, cancel, and view car rentals through a console-based interface. It manages car data by reading from and writing to a file (cars.txt). The system supports different car types, rental prices, and optional features like GPS and sunroof.
